# aim-sensitivity-calculator

Please create a C# .NET Application with ML.NET that calculates what sensetivity the user should use, i already have started with the project which is publically available on github
https://github.com/pnordboj/AimTrainer
I want you to continue this and complete it based on the already existing code that is there. 

The model should be able to record your screen and analyse it as you are playing, it should be a worker service that always runs, the controller UI should be a "config UI" for the background service and the UI should log what the worker service is currently doing

the main application should use math to calculate the data gatherd from the UI and come with a conclution on what sensetivity you should be using.
